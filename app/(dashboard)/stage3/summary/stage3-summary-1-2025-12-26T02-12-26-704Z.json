How will that affect my possibility of getting in to pharmacy course in university, I'm very worried \nMirae: It's completely normal to feel worried, especially when it comes to your future. One low grade won't define your entire academic journey, and there are still many opportunities to improve. Have you considered reaching out for extra help in chemistry or finding study groups? It might really boost your understanding and confidence! What do you think could help you feel more prepared for next time?\nStudent: How can i do better to salvage my grade\nMirae: You’re already taking a great step by wanting to improve! I suggest reaching out to your teacher for extra help or resources, and consider joining a study group with classmates. Practicing past exams or using online resources can also really help. What areas in chemistry do you find most challenging?",
