**SCOPE+ - Career Exploration Problem Statement**

---

## The Problem in One Sentence

**Korean high school students must choose courses and explore career paths under the High School Credit System, but lack a structured, engaging, and data-driven way to translate their interests into concrete course selections—leading to decision paralysis, anxiety, and suboptimal choices based on fear rather than fit.**

---

## Who Has This Problem

**Primary Users:**  
Korean high school students (ages 15-17) in the new High School Credit System (2025+)

**Specific Pain Points by Year:**

**Year 1 (March-April):**
- Must choose course paths without systematic exploration
- Overwhelmed by too many options and no clear process
- Fear making "wrong" decisions without understanding fit
- Pressure to commit before exploring interests

**Year 2:**
- Realizing initial choice may not align with discovered interests
- Want to explore alternatives but don't know how
- Need to understand what courses support their interests
- Lack structured way to reconsider path

**All Years:**
- Career exploration feels like homework, not engaging
- One-time assessments don't build toward actionable outcomes
- No way to track exploration progress over time
- Can't see how interests translate to course selections

---

## Why Now

### New System, New Opportunities, Same Challenges

**Starting 2025**, the High School Credit System promises flexibility:
- Students can choose courses based on interests
- Multiple pathways and recovery mechanisms exist
- System designed for personalized learning

**BUT students still struggle with:**
- How to systematically explore interests
- How to translate interests into course selections
- How to track their exploration journey
- How to make decisions with confidence

**The Gap:**
- Structural flexibility exists, but exploration tools are outdated
- Traditional assessments are one-time and evaluative
- No progressive journey that builds toward decisions
- Lack of gamification makes exploration feel like work

---

## The Core Problem

### Students Lack Structured Exploration Journey

**What's Broken:**

**1. No Progressive Exploration Process**
- Students face all options at once → decision paralysis
- No step-by-step journey from self-understanding to course selection
- Exploration feels overwhelming rather than manageable

**2. Disconnect Between Interests and Courses**
- Students explore careers but don't know which courses support them
- No clear translation from "I like UX design" to "take Design Thinking"
- Gap between interest discovery and actionable course selection

**3. One-Time Assessments Don't Build**
- Career tests give results but don't build toward decisions
- No accumulation of insights across multiple exploration activities
- Each assessment feels disconnected from the next

**4. Lack of Engagement**
- Traditional forms and questionnaires feel like homework
- No gamification or interactive elements
- Students disengage before completing exploration

**5. No Progress Tracking**
- Students can't see where they are in their journey
- No dashboard to track discoveries and insights
- Can't revisit previous exploration data

## Competitive Landscape Analysis

### What Currently Exists

| Solution | What It Does | Why It Doesn't Solve This Problem |
|----------|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| **CareerNet (커리어넷)** | Government platform: career tests, job/school info | **One-time assessment**, evaluative, doesn't translate to course selections |
| **School Counselors** | Brief guidance sessions | **1:400 ratio**, limited time, no structured journey |
| **Hagwon Counseling** | Private academies offer guidance | **Expensive**, biased toward prestige, not exploratory |
| **Career Assessment Tests** | Personality/career matching tests | **One-time**, gives results but no next steps, not engaging |
| **Online Forums (Orbi)** | Student community discussions | **Public**, competitive, advice-giving not exploration |

### The Positioning Gap

**None of these provide:**
- A **structured, progressive journey** through exploration
- **Gamified, engaging** exploration activities
- **Data synthesis** across multiple stages
- **Translation** from interests to course selections
- **Dashboard** to track progress and insights
- **AI-powered recommendations** based on multi-stage data

**Existing solutions are:**
- **One-time:** Single assessment, no building journey
- **Evaluative:** Test you and give results, not exploratory
- **Static:** Forms and questionnaires, not interactive
- **Disconnected:** Each tool separate, no synthesis
- **Not actionable:** Don't translate to course selections

**Our differentiation:** Progressive, gamified, data-driven journey that builds toward concrete course recommendations.

## The Pain

### Immediate (Every Year):

**Year 1:**
- Overwhelm when choosing courses
- Decision paralysis from too many options
- Fear of making wrong choice
- No systematic way to explore

**Year 2:**
- Realizing interests don't match current path
- Want to explore but don't know how
- Can't see how to translate interests to courses
- Feel stuck in current path

**All Years:**
- Exploration feels like work, not discovery
- No way to track what they've learned about themselves
- Can't see progress or build toward decisions
- Anxiety from unstructured exploration

### Long-term Cost:

- Years in misaligned course paths
- Missed opportunities to explore interests
- Reduced confidence in academic choices
- Accumulated regret from fear-driven decisions
- Mental health impact from decision anxiety

### System Cost:

- Credit system's flexibility underutilized
- Students default to "safe" choices rather than exploring fit
- Lost potential from misalignment
- Inequality widens (wealthy families pay for private guidance)

---

## What Currently Happens

### Year 1 (March-April):

1. Attend subject briefing sessions
2. Brief counseling (if available)
3. Consult parents/hagwon
4. **Default to "safe" prestige path without exploration**
5. Choose courses based on fear, not fit

### Year 2:

1. Experience doubt about path
2. Want to explore alternatives
3. **No structured way to reconsider**
4. Stay in current path by default
5. Miss opportunities to align with interests

### What Students DON'T Have:

- Structured exploration journey
- Gamified, engaging exploration activities
- Way to translate interests to courses
- Progress tracking dashboard
- AI-powered recommendations based on exploration
- Multi-stage data synthesis

**The Result:**
> Students make course selections based on fear and default options, without systematic exploration or understanding of how their interests translate to actionable course choices.

---

## The Opportunity

### What Students Need:

**1. Structured Journey**
- Progressive stages that build toward decisions
- Clear path from self-understanding to course selection
- Manageable steps that reduce overwhelm

**2. Engaging Exploration**
- Gamified activities (swipes, tournaments, drag-drop)
- Interactive rather than form-based
- Feels like discovery, not homework

**3. Data Synthesis**
- Insights built across multiple stages
- AI analysis of exploration patterns
- Recommendations based on comprehensive data

**4. Actionable Outcomes**
- Translation from interests to course selections
- Concrete recommendations with rationale
- Clear next steps and pathway

**5. Progress Tracking**
- Dashboard showing journey progress
- Ability to revisit discoveries
- Visual representation of insights

---

## Summary

Korean students face course selection and career exploration without a structured, engaging, data-driven process. The new credit system provides flexibility, but students lack tools that:

- Break exploration into manageable, progressive stages
- Make exploration engaging through gamification
- Synthesize data across multiple activities
- Translate interests into concrete course selections
- Track progress through a dashboard

**The gap:** Between having structural flexibility and having tools that make exploration systematic, engaging, and actionable.

**The solution:** A dashboard-based, multi-stage journey that gamifies exploration, synthesizes data with AI, and builds toward concrete course recommendations.
